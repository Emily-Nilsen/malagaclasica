  // Concert 06
  concert06_date: `06 June, `,
  concert06_title: `ANACRUSA - Opening Concert`,
  concert06_preview: `Just as you find the impulse and energy giving rise to the upbeat of a composition, you will also find elements in the upbeat of this festival that form part of its totality.`,
  concert06_sent_01: `This opening concert presents duo composition intimacy by emphasizing the melody of the voice and representative works of the chamber music repertoire. These works have left no one indifferent since their creation.`,
  concert06_sent_02: `After the sweet songs of Lekeu and Ponce and the well-known 'Granada' by Lara, we will enter the world of a musical revolution in the quasi dissonant 'Grosse Fuge' by Beethoven before diving into one of music lovers' favourites, Dvorak's piano quintet no.2. The latter is a masterpiece that mesmerizes the audience with its combination of expressive lyricism and elements of Czech folk music.`,

  // Concert 07
  concert07_date: `07 June, `,
  concert07_title: `One, Two and Three - CRESCENDO`,
  concert07_preview: `In the musical structure, the crescendo is considered a new door, the beginning of a long journey, and the deepest part and lowest point of a phrase from which everything expands.`,
  concert07_sent_01: `That is why this crescendo begins with a single instrument. Although in a chamber group of more components, one is the extension of the other, a register is the extension of the previous one when it comes to a single instrument.`,
  concert07_sent_02: `The speech takes the form of dialogue in the iconic Sonata no. 3 by Brahms, reflective and passionate. It unfolds in the second part of the concert with the mysterious songs of Poulenc, Fauré and Hahn.`,
  concert07_sent_03: `Finally, the piano trio, which maintains the essence of each instrument, also manages to merge them into a fiery work that highlights Cassadó's mastery.`,

  // Concert 08
  concert08_date: `08 June, `,
  concert08_title: `Four - EQUILIBRIO`,
  concert08_preview: `This piece is composed by the founding father of the string quartet as we know it, Joseph Haydn. It demonstrates the perfect balance in composition due to the richness of range, sound diversity and unity through instrumental timbre.`,
  concert08_sent_01: `In the case of quartet no. 2 by Borodin, we find a work full of loving affection, the dedicatée being his wife, Ekaterina Protopova.`,
  concert08_sent_02: `After studying the string quartets of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven closely during a period of depression, Schumann created his quartet with the piano as part of the ensemble, giving more body to the sound.`,
  concert08_sent_03: `We see the composer's genius creativity through keeping the group as a unified ensemble and conceiving moments of great intimacy and delicacy.`,

  // Concert 09
  concert09_date: `09 June, `,
  concert09_title: `Five and six - DIVERSIÓN`,
  concert09_preview: `Adding instruments to the ensembles gives room for the composers to brilliantly change the texture and give more density to the harmony.`,
  concert09_sent_01: `When a quartet is joined by the piano, forming a quintet, like the renowned Brahms piano quintet in f minor, the piano and strings confront each other as distinct musical forces. But when enlaced together, they have enormous power while still maintaining flexibility.`,
  concert09_sent_02: `The sextet has similar qualities as the quintet. Still, it perhaps leaves each instrument a tad “alleviated” as more instruments are now sharing the workload. A piece like the romantic Souvenir de Florence by Tchaikovsky is as enjoyable and joyous for the players as it is for the listeners.`,

  // Concert 10
  concert10_date: `10 June, `,
  concert10_title: `Seven and eight - SIMBIOSIS`,
  concert10_preview: `What is more straightforward in smaller ensembles is far more complex in a septet regarding the successful intertwining of instrumental lines.`,
  concert10_sent_01: `This piece is of a light spirit and great entertainment through several short movements. Its popularity greatly upset Beethoven, as he would rather have had his more “serious” works getting that kind of attention. Furthermore, the combination of winds and strings in Beethoven’s septet is innovative and exciting since these instruments have very different timbres.`,
  concert10_sent_02: `The string octet can, in most cases, be looked upon as a double quartet, being that there are four principal and four secondary voices of each instrument. In the ensemble, two or more instruments often join together to play the accompaniment and melodies, bordering on the feeling of being a small chamber orchestra.`,
  concert10_sent_03: `Despite being only 16, Mendelssohn masterfully used the eight instruments in his string octet, which is one of the most played and appreciated pieces of the chamber music repertoire.`,

  // Concert 11
  concert11_date: `11 June, `,
  concert11_title: `Nine and ten - VIRTUOSISMO`,
  concert11_preview: `Louis Spohr's nonet was so popular that its instrumentation became the standard for other composers wishing to write for the ensemble.`,
  concert11_sent_01: `It consists of a wind quintet (flute, oboe, clarinet, horn and bassoon) and a string quartet (violin, viola, cello, double bass). The nonet captures the personality of each instrument by displaying a wide variety of colours and the extraordinary imagination of the composer.`,
  concert11_sent_02: `With the simple addition of the second violin to the group, we obtain a decet. Unlike many of his contemporaries, the French composer Theodore Dubois kept to the more traditional romantic style that overshadowed his fame.`,
  concert11_sent_03: `He also wrote a significant amount of sacred music and is one of the few composers that composed pieces for this specific combination of ten instruments.`,

  // Concert 12
  concert12_date: `12 June, `,
  concert12_title: `FORTÍSIMO - Closing concert`,
  concert12_preview: `The orchestra is the full extension of a chamber group on a grand scale.`,
  concert12_sent_01: `The distance between the musicians makes it harder to hear and see each other. The conductor, therefore, leads the group, consisting of up to over 100 members, and guides the players through masterful hand and body language to portray one unified interpretation of the work presented.`,
  concert12_sent_02: `Max Bruch´s violin concerto is dedicated to and premiered by Joseph Joachim. It showcases the violin with its dazzling, virtuosic passages and singing lines and the grandeur and sheer power of the orchestra each time it breaks out in another wonderful tutti. Audiences especially love the piece for its heart-breaking melodies and energetic character.`,
  concert12_sent_03: `In Mendelssohn’s Symphony no.4, titled “The Italian”, we hear the composer’s evoked inspiration from a tour in Italy. With joyful freshness, the four movements represent impressions of the Mediterranean country, also in the form of folk music, the last movement being a fast Neapolitan saltarello.`,
